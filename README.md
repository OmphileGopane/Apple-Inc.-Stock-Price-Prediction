# AppleStockPrediction-ML

## Honors Project - North-West University, South Africa  

### Stock Price Prediction & Forecasting using Machine Learning  

This project focuses on **stock price prediction and forecasting** for **Apple Inc.**, utilizing advanced **Machine Learning models** to analyze market trends and volatility. The models implemented include:  
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** â€“ Capturing temporal dependencies in stock data  
- **eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** â€“ Enhancing predictive accuracy with decision trees  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** â€“ Identifying complex price patterns  

### Explainable AI (XAI) with SHAP Analysis  
To enhance model interpretability, **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** was incorporated, allowing a deeper understanding of the key variables influencing **price fluctuations and market volatility**.

### Data Processing & Feature Engineering  
- **Data Extraction & Cleaning:** Processed Apple Inc. stock data from **Yahoo Finance** using **Microsoft Excel** for structured dataset preparation.  
- **Statistical Analysis:** Employed **Python libraries** such as **Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas** for feature selection and model optimization.  
- **Data Visualization & Reporting:** Utilized **Seaborn, Power BI, and Streamlit** to create interactive dashboards and visual reports, transforming complex financial data into actionable insights.  

### Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Programming Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Seaborn  
- **Visualization:** Power BI, Matplotlib, Streamlit  
- **Data Sources:** Yahoo Finance API, CSV Datasets
